# HELIOS ROOT DOCKER COMPOSE CONFIGURATION
# ===========================================================================
# This is the main orchestration file that ties together all HELIOS services
# It uses Docker Compose's include feature to manage multiple service groups
# while providing shared resources like networks and volumes
# ===========================================================================

name: helios

# Include sub-compose files
# This approach provides modularity while maintaining unified orchestration
include:
  # Console services (management, monitoring, automation)
  - path: ./deployments/console/docker-compose.yml
    project_directory: ./deployments/console
  # Media services (content management, transcoding, downloads)
  - path: ./deployments/media/docker-compose.yml
    project_directory: ./deployments/media

# Shared networks for services that need to communicate across compose files
# This ensures all services can communicate when needed while maintaining
# appropriate isolation between service groups
networks:
  helios_network:
    name: helios_network
    driver: bridge      # Standard bridge network driver

# Shared volumes that can be accessed across services
# These volumes persist data between container restarts and rebuilds
volumes:
  shared_config:
    name: helios_shared_config  # Stores configuration that might be shared between services

# Define secrets to securely handle sensitive information
# These secrets can be accessed by services that need them
secrets:
  plex_token:
    file: ./secrets/plex_token.txt
  homarr_password:
    file: ./secrets/homarr_password.txt

# Common settings and environment variables
# Using YAML anchors (&) for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) configuration
x-common: &common-settings
  restart: unless-stopped      # Ensures services automatically restart unless manually stopped
  environment: &common-env

    PGID: ${PGID}              # Process Group ID - Controls file ownership
    TZ: ${TZ}                  # Timezone setting for accurate scheduling/logs
    UMASK: ${UMASK}            # Controls default file permissions
